    "text" : "Enactus Windsor is a student-led, non-for-profit organization. I worked with elementary students, teaching essential life skills and tutoring academic subjects. I am immensely proud of my contributions to this organization. The most valuable lesson I learned during this time was the difficulty of being an educator. Teaching is an art, it is the amalgamation of personal knowledge, an understanding of the audience, and excellent communication skills. Even now, I often refer back to this experience when writing a report or preparing a presentation to ensure I am properly educating the audience."
