    "text" : "I’m truly blessed to have been given the chance to intern at StockX. This was my first chance to experience the life of a professional software engineer. In my eyes, everything I did here could be described as a spectacular flop. I struggled with basic coding principles, I didn’t understand the technology stack very well, and barely completed my assignment before the internship ended. However, I learned more in those 4 months than my entire computer science studies in college. I learned new programming languages, new development methodologies, and a new appreciation for computer science. Special shout out to my teammates, who were extremely helpful and were willing to sacrifice their time to sort out my problems. "
