    "text": "Right after high school I attended the University of Windsor. In truth I just wanted to attend an university close to home, and expected to spend the next 4 to 5 years of my life drudging through another academic institution. However, UWin has proved to be much more life changing than my original imaginations. At UWin, I was able to meet fellow students from all walks of life, to participate in meaningful extracurricular activities, and to experiment freely.  In the end, I earned a double degree in computer science and business administration, graduated with distinction, and walked away with a love for learning."
